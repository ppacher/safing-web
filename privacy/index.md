CalOPPA is the first state law in the United States of America to
require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy
policy.

The law's reach stretches well beyond California and requires a person
or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that
operates websites/online services collecting personally identifiable
information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy
policy on its website, that states exactly the information being
collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared. If you
would like to read more about this policy, please visit:

## Article 9. Fair Information Practices, explained

The Fair Information Practices Principles, form the backbone of privacy
law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a
significant role in the development of data protection laws around the
world, understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how
they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various
privacy laws that protect personal information. In order to be in line
with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive
action, should a data breach occur:

• We will notify the users via email within 1 business day.

• We will notify the users via in site notification within 1 business
day.

We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that
individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against
data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This
principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights
against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or
a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by
data processors.
